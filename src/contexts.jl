"""
    mapfoldl(xf, step, init, itr) :: T
    transduce(xf, step, init, itr) :: Union{T, Reduced{T}}

Compose transducer `xf` with reducing step function `f` and
reduce `iter` using it.

!!! warning
    `transduce` differs from `mapfoldl` as `Reduced{T}` is returned if
    the transducer `xf` or `step` aborts the reduction.

This API is modeled after $(_cljref("transduce")).

# Arguments
- `xf::Transducer`: A transducer.
- `step`: A callable which accepts 1 and 2 arguments.  If it only
  accepts 2 arguments, wrap it by [`Completing`](@ref) to add
  [`complete`](@ref) protocol.
- `init`: An initial value fed to the first argument to reducing step
  function `step`.
- `itr`: An iterable.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> using Transducers

julia> function step_demo(state, input)
           @show state, input
           state + input
       end;

julia> function step_demo(state)
           println("Finishing with state = ", state)

(state, input) = (0.0, 1)
(state, input) = (1.0, 3)
